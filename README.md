PRank Score based on the Matrix Form

## Introduction
PRank Score based on the Matrix Form is a implementation of aSTEAM Project (Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT). The function of this software is to rank a web page based on a matrix such as PageRank.


## Requirements and Dependencies
* PRankMatrixForm_ThreadEdition.java computes PRank scores with threads based on the matrix form.
* PRankMatrixForm.java computes PRank scores based on the matrix form.
* DataPreparing.java and FileReading.java read the graphs and prepare data for the two above classes.

You need two files represent the dataset:
1. One file contains the main graph where each line represents an edge (i.e., a \tab b means a-->b) .
2. One file contains the reverse graph where each line represents a reverse edge in the main graph (i.e., b \tab a means b-->a).
